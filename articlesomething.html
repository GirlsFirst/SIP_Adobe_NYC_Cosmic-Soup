    With schools out for the summer, ask a high school student about his or her plans for the break, and chances are high that you will hear one word in the response: sleep. Summer is a great time for students to catch up on their rest, but it is also an opportune time for parents, teachers and administrators to reevaluate how their practices and policies may contribute to students' lack of sleep during the school year. Sleep deprivation is a serious issue for many adolescents, as it affects emotional and behavioral functioning, overall safety, and learning and development.
    </p>
    <p class ="first">
    My research with colleagues at Challenge Success, a research and intervention project based at Stanford University, has found that sleep deprivation is particularly acute at some schools. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adolescents get eight to 10 hours of sleep each night. However, high school students in our sample, drawn from dozens of high-performing schools from across the country, report an average of 6.8 hours, with the averages in some schools falling as low as six hours during week nights. Furthermore, well over half of the students in our studies report experiencing frequent exhaustion or difficulty falling asleep due to stress. Other studies of nationally representative samples of high school students find that fewer than 10 percent obtain 9 or more hours of sleep a night, the guideline recommended for teens by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    </p>
        
    <p class="first">
       Ample research has documented the importance of sleep for healthy brain development and overall well-being. It is when one sleeps that the brain strengthens the neural pathways that cement the learning that took place that day. Our research finds that students who experience exhaustion are also more likely to report other mental and physical health problems, such as depression and headaches.
    </p>

    <p class="first">
    So what can be done to help adolescents get the sleep they need during the school year? Here are three sets of suggestions for the adults in these teens' lives, based on our 10 years of working with families and schools.
    </p>
     
    <p class="first">
    <strong>Parents should set boundaries around screen-time.</strong> Students tell us that they have social media sites, like YikYak and Tinder, open on their computers as they are doing their homework, and that their smart phones keep pinging with incoming texts, Instagrams and Snapchats throughout the night. The incessant interruptions can prove distracting, making homework take longer than it needs to and compromising any learning it may be designed to promote. And when left on a bedside table to buzz through the night, smart phones can also disrupt sleep.
    </p>

    <p class="first">
    In one family I know, the parents confiscate all technological devices after dinner, making it necessary for their children to complete any homework assignments that require Internet access or word processing before the family repast. Other parents have rules about where in the house their children can work on computers, and usually these designated spaces offer a vantage point from which parents can monitor the potential intrusions of social media as their children work.
    </p>
  
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="two" id="element2">
    <p class="first">
  But as Sam Fulwood III, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who focuses on race and media issues, argues, what may be making students so uncomfortable aren’t so much the icons themselves but rather “the mindset behind defending” those icons. “They want the college to reflect themselves—and the traditions and the symbols of a college experience, in their mind, do not do that,” he told me. “What these students have done has been to draw attention … to those traditions” and what they represent.

  <p class="first">
  This sort of activism—rallying for both the aspirational and the tangible—is also part of being a young, college student, according to Fulwood. “The students who are discovering Woodrow Wilson’s legacy at Princeton are behaving as if they were the first people to ever find out that he was a racist,” he continued. “There’s nothing like a new convert—there’s nothing like getting new information that sets you on fire … [They’re] coming to realize that they can challenge assumptions that sometimes have been deified by institutions, so there is some value in talking about the iconography on a college campus.”
  </p>
  
  <p class="first">
    Schools’ gradual withdrawal from certain traditions could be significant in that it indicates a willingness to embrace the new era into which they’re being thrust—an era marked by rapid demographic change, declining numbers of high-school graduates nationwide, and mass mobilization by people whom they’ve marginalized. “In an earlier time, the purpose of a liberal arts college education was to enlighten and educate the most socially advanced members of American society,” Fulwood wrote in a recent paper. It was reserved for white men “who were assumed to be future leaders of government, captains of industry, and masters of the universe”; students of color and women were rarely welcomed.
  </p>
   
  <p class="first">
    Nobody thinks—or at least says—this anymore. A visit to any of the elite college campuses across the nation, however, reveals that traditions die hard and that change comes slowly. Debates over the names attached to buildings and the iconography of prominent alumni prove that little has shifted: Sometimes, the past is offensive to the present, leading to conflict and protests …
  </p>
  
  <p class="first">
  In effect, what we are seeing on college campuses today is the boisterous struggle of marginalized groups who are reshaping the old college life to fit their contemporary realities. College administrators are trapped, flat-footed, and wide-eyed in the middle of a social and cultural shift that they are seemingly unprepared to accommodate. And it is likely to get worse for those who want to retain the norm of the hallowed halls.
  </p>

  <p class="first">
  According to Fulwood, for colleges, even changing the name of a building is difficult. Conceding to one demand opens the door to conceding to more, which could mean fundamentally changing the role of higher education to meet the needs of one constituency over others.
  </p>

  <p class="first">
  And ultimately, Fulwood agrees with Williams and others in that erasing certain symbols and traditions could do more harm than good. “Attempting to sanitize [the iconography] and take it away in the guise of ‘This makes me feel better,’ I think, is misguided,” Fulwood said. “Changing the name doesn’t do anything but hide the actual history of what went on on the campus, and that is a far worst place for education because it can pretend that it never happened.”
