    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="first"> The Women Project began in a very spontaneous and unpretentious way. My initial goal was just to practice my technique with colored pencils while saying something nice to my friends who already followed my work. When looking for a theme, I opted for intersectionality for being something that I acknowledge as a personal issue. It always bothered me the world's constant attempts to control women's bodies, behaviors and identities. This control is such a deep part of our culture that we hardly ever realize how cruel it is and how it restricts our personal choices. However, I don't believe it's enough to discuss exclusively the issues that affect a specific group of women. We also need to talk about racism, homophobia, transphobia, classicism, xenophobia and ableism. The fight for equality and respect is very wide and should be inclusive.<p>
    <p class="first"> Not all the situations that I portray are lived exclusively by women. Several of them can be experienced by any human being, and I invite all men to identify as well. This is not a project exclusively for women, nor only about women, neither about all women at the same time. The decision to draw only women was partly motivated by a personal identification. But on the other hand, I find it interesting to awaken in men the chance to identify with female characters. I remember that when I was a kid it was common that the  movies / books / animations starring female characters were seen as "for girls", while stories with male characters were "for everyone". The fact that my protagonists are women does not make this is project just "for girls".
